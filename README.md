# Usage
This repository has the intention of providing a quick frontend styling without any frameworks or external libraries, just pure HTML and CSS; therefore, you don't need to install anything, and can use whatever asset fits your needs: HTML partials or just the respective stylesheets.

The main stylesheet has default values set. You can change them by manually writing your own values in the `:root` element of `styles.css`.
